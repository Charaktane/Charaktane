# Hello, world! I'm Charaktane. 👋✨

<div>
  <h2>Welcome to my world of code and caffeine. 🖥️☕ You might think you know what's going on here, but trust me, you don't.</h2>
  
  <h3>🌙 A Little About Me (Not that you really care)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🖤 Night owl programmer who works best when everyone else is sleeping. Don't interrupt me.</li>
    <li>🚀 I explore technology the same way House explores diagnoses — with contempt and, sometimes, bursts of brilliance.</li>
    <li>☕ My fuel: coffee, chocolate, and a little chaos. What else do you need?</li>
    <li>🕹️ Gaming, coding, and fixing broken things — that's my idea of fun.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ Technologies I Support (and sometimes even love)</h3>
