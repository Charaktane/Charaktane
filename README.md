# Hello, world! I'm Charaktane. 👋✨  
But you probably already knew that. 🧐

<div>
  <h2>Welcome to my world of code and caffeine. 🖥️☕ You might think you know what’s going on here, but trust me, you don’t.</h2>
  
  <h3>🌙 A Little About Me (Not that you really care)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🖤 Night owl coder who works best when everyone is asleep. Don’t disturb.</li>
    <li>🚀 I explore tech the way House explores diagnoses — with disdain and occasional bursts of brilliance.</li>
    <li>☕ My fuel: coffee, chocolate, and a little bit of chaos. What else do you need?</li>
    <li>🕹️ Gaming, coding, and fixing broken things — that's my idea of a good time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>🛠️ Tech I Tolerate (and sometimes love)</h3>

  <h3> 🔍 My Specialities (Not that you would understand)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Code Analysis — I'll find the bugs before you even know they're there. No, I won't explain how.</li>
    <li>Debugging — I’ll fix your mess, but you’ll never fully understand what went wrong. It’s better that way.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> 💻 Currently Working On: QR-Score</h3>
  <i> It’s a mess, but I’ll sort it out. Eventually. Because I’m me, and I always do.</i>
